#Getting Started

Install npm
Follow Ionic's installation guide
Do 'npm install'
Do 'grunt watch' when you're ready to start writing code

# Current dev setup
Just run 'grunt' from this directory.
grunt will then do 3 things:
'ionic serve' will serve your work from localhost, it watches for changes so you can see your changes live
'npm test' will launch karma, which will run your tests whenever there is a change
'includeSource' which will automatically include js and css into index.html when there are changes
